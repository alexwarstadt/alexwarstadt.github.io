As a computational linguist, I use language models and other tools from natural language processing 
to further our understanding of human language meaning, structure, and acquisition. 
I also use insights from linguistics to evaluate and interpret language models. 
I work to use language models as cognitive models to gain insights about language that cannot be easily gotten 
from studying human subjects, and to build more cognitively models.

I’m currently an ETH Postdoctoral Fellow at ETH Zürich, affiliated with [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/). 
Starting in January 2025, I will be and Assistant Professor at UC San Diego with appointments [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/) and the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/).
