## Information Theory in Linguistics
Winter 2025. 

LIGN 187. Topics in Linguistics: Information Theory in Linguistics.

[//]: # ([Course Syllabus]&#40;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iz_mn0Jcp4kWEI0aJUfSvKu3CA7ljoj4r_tLVdJS47o/edit?usp=sharing&#41;)

[//]: # (**Course Description** In 1948 Claude Shannon discovered the concept of entropy, )

[//]: # (kicking off the field of Information Theory and revolutionizing the study of physics, computer science, and genetics. )

[//]: # (Information theory is a mathematical theory for quantifying communication, )

[//]: # (but its impact on linguistic theory are only gradually becoming recognized. )

[//]: # (This course provides an accessible and intuitive introduction to fundamental concepts such as )

[//]: # (bits, entropy, and mutual information using linguistic case studies. )

[//]: # (We then study how information theory is beginning to impact linguistics, cognitive science, and natural language processing. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We will explore questions such as:)

[//]: # (- How does the brain process language during reading?)

[//]: # (- What principles determine the optimal lengths of words?)

[//]: # (- How much information do large language models encode about syntax and semantics? )

[//]: # (- What does it mean for a speech act to be relevant to a conversation?)

[//]: # (- How can we test large language models for harmful stereotypes? )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (**Assignments** Students will be able to choose between reading-focused or coding-focused homework assignments in line with their interests and skills. )

[//]: # (The course will culminate in a final project, which can also take a few different forms depending on the student's interests. )

[//]: # (Students may write a paper as individuals or as a group of up to three. )

[//]: # (Individual students may also submit a data analysis.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (**Prerequisites:** Prior coursework in linguistics, cognitive science, or machine learning is recommended, but it is not required to have a background in each of these areas.)
