# Information Theory in Linguistics
Winter 2025. 

LIGN 187. Topics in Linguistics: Information Theory in Linguistics.

Course site and syllabus TBA.

An advanced undergraduate course taking a quantitative, computational, experimental, and cognitive approach to linguistics.
We introduce foundational mathematical concepts in information theory, such as entropy, surprisal, and mutual information.
After covering their theoretical underpinning and justification, we discuss how they are applied to linguistics.
We discuss classic and cutting-edge research in linguistics, machine learning, and cognitive science
that uses these concepts to advance our understanding of human language.
Topics include:
- how the brain processes language during reading
- why the lexicon is structured the way it is
- how to quantify the pragmatic relevance of an answer in a discourse
- how children use the principles of simplicity in language acquisition
