## Information Theory in Linguistics
Winter 2025. 

LIGN 187. Topics in Linguistics: Information Theory in Linguistics.

Course site and syllabus TBA.

Information theory is the mathematical framework for quantifying information and
communication. It has found applications in many fields, from computer science
and engineering to physics and genetics. While providing an accessible
introduction to the fundamental concepts of information theory with a focus on
linguistic case studies, we discuss applications of those concepts in both classic
and recent research in linguistics, cognitive science, and natural language
processing.
Possible topics include:
- How does the brain processes language during reading?
- What principles determine the optimal lengths of words?
- How do interlocutors quantify the pragmatic relevance of an answer in a discourse?
- How can we test large language models for harmful stereotypes?
- How does a learning bias favoring simplicity shape human language acquisition?
