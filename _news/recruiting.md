I'm now recruiting PhD students to start fall quarter 2026 through 
the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/grad/application.html) only.
I am open to co-advising students in the [Halıcığlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions/), 
but if you specifically want to work with me, please apply to Linguistics.

It is really truly not necessary to reach out to me directly.
If you apply through UCSD's portal, I will read your application.
But if you insist on writing to me,
please send an email with “[PhD Applicant]” in the subject line.
Briefly describe your research interests, include a CV,
and pitch a project or two that you might work on as a PhD student.
I can't respond to everyone, but I do read your emails.

The ideal candidate has strong programming skills, experience with ML engineering,
and a sense of curiosity and wonder about human language!
You have to apply through the portal linked on one of the department websites linked above.
I strongly suggest reviewing the requirements for the program before applying.
